# Global Lake View (GLV) Dataset

Hello and welcome to my GitHub! I'm delighted to introduce you to the **Global Lake View (GLV) Dataset**, a pioneering collection dedicated to the realm of lake water body extraction across a myriad of global terrains.

## Introduction

The world is home to countless lakes, each with its unique ecological and geographical characteristics. Recognizing the need for a comprehensive dataset that captures this diversity, I've curated the GLV Dataset. Sourced from the extensive array of satellite images on Google Earth, this dataset boasts 1,120 RGB images, each with a high native resolution of 1200 × 1200 pixels. Spanning all seven continents, it ensures a broad representation of terrains.

What sets the GLV Dataset apart is its emphasis on:

- **Ecological Diversity**: The GLV dataset endeavors to encompass a myriad of terrains, ranging from dense forests to expansive plateaus and undulating hills.

- **Altitudinal Variability**: With images collected from varied viewpoint altitudes ranging between 2km and 40km, the dataset offers both expansive views and intricate details.

- **Data Volume Strategy**: Prioritizing authenticity, the GLV Dataset retains the original image resolution, ensuring the true essence of each capture is preserved. 


## Download

At the moment, you'll find a few sample entries from this dataset here on my GitHub page. These examples should give you a glimpse of the valuable information these collections encompass. 

I look forward to making the full datasets available **after the publication of my related academic paper**. This is also my first paper on the GLV dataset. The upcoming release will significantly amplify the depth and scope of resources available here for fellow researchers and practitioners in the field.

I invite you to explore these samples, and keep an eye out for the full release. I'm confident these datasets will provide valuable insights and contribute significantly to the community. Happy exploring!
